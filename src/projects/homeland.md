My goals in building Homeland was to become comfortable with Redux and be able to integrate CRUD for a fullstack application.

I eventually added Socket IO for real time updates between online users and integrated Cloudinary to handle image uploads and delivery.

Difficulties I faced included managing and knowing when to clear certain states to prevent unwanted side effects â€“ undefined variables, janky UI & old states appearing momentarily.
