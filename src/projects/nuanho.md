The intention of the site is to showcase the art in a clean way. Information had to be simple and exactly what potential visitors would require. Embla allows for a smooth ‘Instagram-like’ carousell on mobile.

I integrated NetlifyCMS to allow him to upload new artworks with relevant information straight to the site. The gallery lightbox uses Embla, a smooth carousel that delivers super smooth performance on mobile – similar to an Instagram carousel.

Many carousels had inconsistent behaviour and performance on mobile and I wanted a specific feel.
