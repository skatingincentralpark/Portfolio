        </li>
        <li>

          a confession of their character."
        </li>
        <li>
          When friendships are real, they are not glass threads or frost work,
          but the solidest things we can know."
        </li>
        <li>You become what you think about all day long."</li>
        <li>
          Character is higher than intellect... A great soul will be strong to

          ever achieved."
        </li>
        <li>The ancestor of every action is a thought."</li>
        <li>
          The good news is that the moment you decide that what you know is more
          important than what you have been taught to believe, you will have

          permanent state."
        </li>
        <li>
          I do not wish more external goods--neither possessions, nor honors,

          always right."
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>Manners require time and nothing is more vulgar than haste."</li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>All is riddle and the key to a riddle is another riddle."</li>
        <li>
          All the good of nature is the soul's, and may be had, if paid for in
